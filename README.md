# Customer Data Platform GraphQL API OASIS Standard
The new GraphQL API for the OASIS CXS Customer Data Platform specification, including sample test implementation
in Javascript.

This work is being done by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee (see https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cxs), and the new (upcoming) specification was renamed to the Customer Data Platform specification as this term has emerged recently as a standard denomination for the work started initially as the Context Server.

You can find work-in-progress snapshots of the current draft being work on at the following location:

## Status

The GraphQL API is mostly defined, most of the work in now going into producing the actual specification document (written in ASCIIDoc format in the docs/ subdirectory).

## Specification document generation

Simply launch the generation of the specification document into HTML by using the following command:

    ./gradlew asciidoctor
    
This will generate the HTML version of the ASCII Doctor specification in the following directory:

    build/docs

## JavaScript server

### Requirements

- NodeJS 6.9+
- NPM 4.1+

### Building and launching

To test the server simply launch

    cd javascript
    npm install
    npm start
    
You can then connect a browser to the following URL:

    http://localhost:4000
